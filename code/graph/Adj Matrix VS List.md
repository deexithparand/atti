Here’s a **concise and simple comparison** between the two pairs of data structures:

### **2D Vector vs. Array of Vectors**
| Feature                     | **2D Vector (`vector<vector<int>>`)**                     | **Array of Vectors (`vector<int> arr[]`)**                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flexibility**             | Size can be dynamically resized in both rows and columns.| Each row (vector) can grow dynamically, but the array size is fixed. |
| **Ease of Use**             | Easier for fully dynamic matrices, especially for resizing both dimensions.| Works well when the number of rows is known beforehand but allows dynamic columns. |
| **Performance**             | Slightly slower due to extra indirection for dynamic allocation of both rows and columns.| Faster for fixed row size as the outer array is static. |
| **Syntax Simplicity**       | Requires `vector<vector<int>>` syntax for declaration and access.| Requires `vector<int> arr[n]` syntax. |
| **Memory**                  | Uses slightly more memory overhead due to dynamic allocation in both dimensions.| Slightly more efficient since the outer array is static. |
| **Use Case**                | Ideal for fully dynamic 2D matrices where both dimensions may change.| Ideal for adjacency lists or structures where rows (number of vertices) are fixed. |

### **Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List**
| Feature                     | **Adjacency Matrix**                        | **Adjacency List**                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**               | A 2D array or vector (`n x n`) to store edges. Each cell `matrix[u][v]` indicates whether an edge exists between `u` and `v`.| An array or vector of vectors/lists where `adj[u]` stores neighbors of vertex `u`.|
| **Space Complexity**        | \(O(n^2)\) — even for sparse graphs.        | \(O(V + E)\) — proportional to the number of vertices and edges. |
| **Time Complexity**         | - **Check edge existence:** \(O(1)\)       - **Add/Delete edge:** \(O(1)\) | - **Check edge existence:** \(O(\text{degree of } u)\) - **Add edge:** \(O(1)\) - **Delete edge:** \(O(\text{degree of } u)\) |
| **Memory Usage**            | Inefficient for sparse graphs as it wastes memory for unused edges.| Efficient for sparse graphs as it only stores actual edges. |
| **Ease of Implementation**  | Easy to implement.                         | Slightly more complex but manageable.      |
| **Use Case**                | Suitable for dense graphs or when edges need to be checked quickly.| Suitable for sparse graphs or when memory is a concern.    |

### **Summary**:
1. Use **2D Vector** for fully dynamic grids/matrices and **Array of Vectors** for fixed rows with dynamic columns (e.g., adjacency lists).
2. Use **Adjacency Matrix** for dense graphs or frequent edge lookups and **Adjacency List** for sparse graphs or memory-efficient representation.
